1.  Windows installation

   Copy the executable file from this directory to any directory
on your system. If you are using Windows 3.x or some early versions
of Win 95 then you should copy winacts.exe. Otherwise copy files
winacts-32bit.exe and the 4 .dll files in this directory. If you use
the 32-bit version, then all of the files should be copied to the 
same directory on your system. The other files in this directory provide 
additional information and source code but are not required to run the 
program.

   You can create a short-cut to the program to make it easier to
run it. To do this, open the Windows explorer and go to the directory
where you stored the program. Point to the program name with the
mouse/cursor, hold down the left mouse button and drag the file to
your desktop. This will create an icon on your desktop with the
program name.  You can then run the program at any time  by 
double-clicking on the icon.

   Start the program and look at the various help messages for more 
information. In particular, see Help | Getting Started. After you have 
configured the program save this configuration using File | Save Config. 
You will only have to do this the first time you run the program or after 
you make a change to the configuration.

  If you have created a short-cut to the program on your desktop, you
can edit the short-cut to implement the "once" command as described in
the help messages. To do this, right-click on the short-cut and open
its properties. Look at the target command line, and add the word
"once" at the end of this line, leaving at least one space before and
after this entry. You can enter the word in any combination of upper
and lower case letters. Do not use the quotation marks and do not
change anything else.

2. Removing the program

   You can remove the executable file by simply deleting it using the 
explorer. The 4 .dll files used by the 32-bit version can also be removed 
in this way if they are not used by some other program. (If you are in 
doubt about this, it is safest to leave these files alone.) In addition, 
the program may create two other small files. These are located in the 
system directory, which is usually c:\windows or c:\winnt.  These files 
are:

	winacts.cfg		(holds configuration if you have saved it)
	nistime.dif		(holds time differences if you select this)

These files also can be deleted using the explorer.

The program does not modify the registry or use any other files.
